# COVID19 Drug Discovery Project
Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/drug-discovery-data

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 5 million deaths worldwide since 2020 (worldometers.info). Despite innovations in mRNA vaccination research, creation and distribution, many people still refuse to get vaccinated or seek other sources of treatment. This underscores a crucial need for therapeutics that are effective against killing the coronavirus and it's variants responsible for infection. The dataset from a kaggle.com competition has 100s of compounds that were screened for activity against the virus. This project seeks to determine if we can predict the pIC50 values of molecules based on various features that are electronically and experimentally generated. Generating predictions based on molecular properties of these compounds can drastically decrease the amount of resources that goes into synthesis and testing, giving researchers a more clear direction in which to focus their efforts. The prediction model will be trained on pre-labeled data, and used to predict if unlabled compounds possess any activity. Then, for both testing and training sets, the structures of the compounds will be examined for any potential pharmacophores to give hints to the mechanism of action.
